##Important points
1) no header needed
2) VEP annotated first column must be in the format (chr_pos_ref/alt)
3) Correct VEP annotated file and remove chromosomes that are not 1-to-22 plus X-Y
4) Be sure that you are using the GNU command line if you are running in a macosx (https://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/)
5) Rscript from R must be in your path

###The UNIX system used should be able to recognize \t as a tab separator

##To get help run the following command wo arguments
./run_negDriver

##To run with only missense and specifying a particular counts file
##./run_negDriver input_file output_name output_folder -m data/finalVEP.triplets.counts

##Notes
-Genome fasta file should be formated all uppercase with chromosome labels as {1,2,3,4....X,Y}
-Annotated mutation file from VEP should not contain MT or GL chromosomes
