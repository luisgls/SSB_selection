#Mega tool to detect positively selected and negatively selected genes in cancer exomes.
#Luis Zapata 2017

#Step by Step
1) Download zipped data to run the tool from synapse syn11681953
1.1) Create data folder within the cloned folder
1.2) Unzip data into data folder
1.3) Open run_negDriver script and specify the location of the genome file (e.g. hg19.genome) and the fasta file (e.g. hg19.fasta) 
1.4) 



##Important points before running
1) No header needed for input VEP file
2) VEP annotated first column must be in the format (chr_pos_ref/alt)
3) VEP annotated file must only have chromosomes that are 1,2,3,4...22 or X,Y
4) Be sure that you are using the GNU command line if you are running in a MacOS (https://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x/)
5) Add dependencies to your path for easy running or hardcode the scripts

###The UNIX system used should be able to recognize \t as a tab separator

##To get help run the following command wo arguments
./run_negDriver

##To run with only missense and specifying a particular counts file
##./run_negDriver input_file output_name output_folder -m data/finalVEP.triplets.counts

##Notes
-Genome fasta file should be formated all uppercase with chromosome labels as {1,2,3,4....X,Y}
-Annotated mutation file from VEP should not contain MT or GL chromosomes

##Dependencies
bedtools 2.26.0
R-3.3.3
R library tidyr
perl 5
GNU command line tools
